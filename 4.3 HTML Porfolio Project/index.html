        <h4>ARMANI PRIVÉ - Sephora Champs Elysées</h4>
        <p>I successfully built this project under an extremely tight deadline during the summer when manufacturing operations are typically slower due to reduced staffing levels. Despite this challenge, I managed to find factories that met the client’s requirements and provided high-quality materials that adhered to their specifications. I delivered the entire project on time and participated in the installation at Sephora Champs Elysées for the launch of ARMANI PRIVÉ’s high-end niche fragrances.</p>

    <div class="work-item">
        <h4>POP UP CENTRAL CARVEN PARFUMS - Galeries Lafayette Haussmann</h4>
        <p>I am particularly proud of this project as the Carven brand is traditionally known for its fashion clothing. They ventured into creating perfumes to reflect the travels and experiences of Madame Carven, which inspired her clothing designs. I had the pleasure of understanding the brand's identity and creating a branding strategy that is now used globally. This project was built in just three months for a pop-up that lasted 15 days in the prestigious Galeries Lafayette Haussmann, a central location with excellent visibility.</p>
